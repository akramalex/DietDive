 # bug

##  Unresolved bugs

 There are no other unresolved bugs that I am aware of.

 ### Fixed Bugs

 * After deploying on Heroku, the CSS was not working properly. This issue was resolved by running the collectstatic command.

 * The JavaScript for the comment functionality was working fine on the live app but not in the local terminal. The issue was caused because I updated the JavaScript file in the staticfiles folder instead of the static folder. This was fixed by updating the JavaScript file in the correct static folder.
